# Shared-Code
This is my shared code for solving quantum-many body system by tensor network

# PXP model
The model is typically used to describe quantum chaos and scar in Redberg atom system
It breaks the ergodic hyphothesis

# Main program
I compare the result from ED and that from TDVP to display the accuracy of my program
